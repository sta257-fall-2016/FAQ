# FAQ

There are a few textbook questions that many students are asking about when they visit, so I here I will put some explanation of some of them that come up most frequently.

This doesn't mean you still aren't allowed to visit or ask about anything, including these questions. But if these written explanations are good enough for you then it might save you some time.
